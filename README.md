IR Challenge 2

A user indicates to you that they were having audio issues, so they went to what they thought was RealTek's website to update their drivers. Unfortunately, their audio issues did not improve, and other issues began to pop up as a result. They have brought you in, and you find the zip file attached (password will be provided to you), and some screenshots of some suspicious activity were found as well. Based on the information provided, please write up an IR report detailing what you've found.

**PLEASE NOTE**


Open the zip on an isolated VM. 
As a best practice, if you plan to execute anything, please take a snapshot beforehand, and restore to that snapshot once you are done analyzing the file(s).
Analyze the file(s) as you see fit, and include any information gathered in the report.
